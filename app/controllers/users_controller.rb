  #Mass assignment - when an entire hash is used to assign attributes to object
  #e.g   @user = User.new(params[:user]) - params contains name,email etc

  #Problem with this is, any attributes there that should not be changed can also be
  #changed by putting it in with the hash e.g admin = true for a User object

  #So rails solves this through Strong parameters. Instead of mass assignment like above
  #using params object directly, use function like one below:

  #require - this parameter is required, if not error thrown
  #permit - these parameters are allowed. Can use permit to change which
  #parameters allowed and which are not. So if admin boolean added later,
  #e.g don't include it in permit, everything is fine.
